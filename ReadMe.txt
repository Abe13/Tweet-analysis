In the search of El-Farol bar problem

“That place is so crowded that no one goes there any more”.

The problem is as follows: There is a particular, finite population of people. Every Thursday night, all of these people want to go to the El Farol Bar. However, the El Farol is quite small, and it's no fun to go there if it's too crowded. So much so, in fact, that the preferences of the population can be described as follows:If less than 60% of the population go to the bar, they'll all have a better time than if they stayed at home.
If more than 60% of the population go to the bar, they'll all have a worse time than if they stayed at home.
Unfortunately, it is necessary for everyone to decide at the same time whether they will go to the bar or not. They cannot wait and see how many others go on a particular Thursday before deciding to go themselves on that Thursday.

I analysed the outcome of a famous dance competition show using the record of dancers' performances, recorded as scores awarded by a judging panel and the public's sentiment, reflected in tweets on Twitter. 
My study first shows that the outcome of the voting mechanisms with publicly known signals can be understood using a game theoretic model known as the El-Farol game. 
And the second, it shows that the relationship between the wisdom of crowds and the outcomes of a voting structure cannot be described by a linear function and can therefore lead to very contradictory results.
